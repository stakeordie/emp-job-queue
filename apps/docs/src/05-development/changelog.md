# EmProps AI Backend Development Changelog

## [Unreleased] - Current Session

### üîß **Container Environment Variable Baking**

#### **Environment Variables Built Into Container Images**
- **Problem**: Container images required runtime environment variables (like WORKERS, MACHINE_ID) to function, breaking standalone deployment
- **Root Cause**: Environment variables only set in docker-compose runtime, not baked into images
- **Solution**:
  - ‚úÖ Updated compose-build.js to pass all environment variables as build args
  - ‚úÖ Modified Dockerfile profiles (base, comfyui, simulation) to convert build args to ENV
  - ‚úÖ Removed runtime environment section to ensure local/production parity
- **Impact**: Container images are now self-contained and work identically in local and production environments
- **Files**: `scripts/env/compose-build.js`, `apps/machine/Dockerfile`

**Environment Parity**: Local development now gets the exact same environment as production deployments, eliminating false positives and ensuring true consistency.

### üîß **Remote Worker Mode Fixes**

#### **Service Mapping Resolution for Remote Downloads**
- **Problem**: PM2 ecosystem generator failed when using remote worker downloads (WORKER_BUNDLE_MODE=remote)
- **Root Cause**: service-mapping.json only looked in `/workspace/worker-bundled/` which doesn't exist in remote mode
- **Solution**:
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced PM2 ecosystem generator to check multiple paths for service-mapping.json
  - ‚úÖ Added fallback to copy service-mapping.json from service-manager if not in downloaded bundle
  - ‚úÖ Updated Redis worker service to ensure service-mapping.json is available after extraction
- **Impact**: Remote worker mode now works correctly, allowing production deployments to download workers from GitHub releases
- **Files**: `apps/machine/src/config/enhanced-pm2-ecosystem-generator.js`, `apps/machine/src/services/redis-worker-service.js`

### üîß **Production Environment Configuration Updates**

#### **API & Redis Migration to Production Infrastructure**
- **Problem**: Development configurations pointing to local/test environments
- **Solution**: 
  - ‚úÖ Updated API endpoint to `qredapi.emerge.pizza` for production deployment
  - ‚úÖ Migrated Redis URL to production instance at `pqred.emerge.pizza`
  - ‚úÖ Updated monitor WebSocket connection to use production API endpoint
  - ‚úÖ Aligned CORS settings with production domains
- **Impact**: System ready for production deployment with proper infrastructure endpoints
- **Files**: `apps/api/.env`, `config/environments/components/api.env`, `config/environments/components/redis.env`

#### **Enhanced Simulation Service Configuration**
- **Problem**: Simulation service limited to single instance, not utilizing mock GPU scaling
- **Solution**:
  - ‚úÖ Changed resource binding from `cpu` to `mock_gpu` for proper scaling
  - ‚úÖ Increased instances per machine from 1 to 10 for simulation service
  - ‚úÖ Added `MOCK_GPU_NUM` environment variable support in PM2 ecosystem generator
  - ‚úÖ Created new `sim` service profile in docker-compose for simplified deployment
- **Impact**: Simulation service can now properly scale to test multi-GPU scenarios
- **Files**: `apps/machine/src/config/service-mapping.json`, `apps/machine/src/config/enhanced-pm2-ecosystem-generator.js`

#### **Worker Environment Variable Improvements**
- **Problem**: Workers missing common environment variables needed for unified machine status
- **Solution**:
  - ‚úÖ Added base environment variables to all connector types via `BaseConnector.getRequiredEnvVars()`
  - ‚úÖ Included `UNIFIED_MACHINE_STATUS`, `HUB_REDIS_URL`, `MACHINE_ID`, `WORKER_ID` in base
  - ‚úÖ OpenAI connectors now properly inherit base environment variables
  - ‚úÖ Fixed worker ID handling to use PM2-provided unique IDs directly
- **Impact**: All workers now have consistent environment configuration for proper status reporting
- **Files**: `apps/worker/src/connectors/base-connector.ts`, `apps/worker/src/connectors/openai-*.ts`, `apps/worker/src/redis-direct-worker.ts`

#### **Docker Compose Service Restructuring**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent service definitions and environment configurations
- **Solution**:
  - ‚úÖ Standardized service definitions across all profiles
  - ‚úÖ Fixed `comfyui-remote` and `openai` service configurations
  - ‚úÖ Changed default environment from `local` to `production`
  - ‚úÖ Added proper MACHINE_ID environment variables to all services
- **Impact**: Consistent and reliable service deployment across all machine types
- **Files**: `apps/machine/docker-compose.yml`

**Advances North Star**: These configuration updates prepare the system for production deployment and enable proper testing of specialized machine pools through enhanced simulation capabilities.

### üîß **CRITICAL RELIABILITY FIXES**

#### **PHANTOM MACHINE ELIMINATION - Monitor Trust Restored**
- **Problem**: Monitor showed persistent "basic-machine" when nothing was actually running
- **Root Cause**: Redis machine registrations had no TTL and stale detection relied on in-memory state lost on API restart
- **Solution**: 
  - ‚úÖ Added 120-second TTL to all machine and worker registrations in Redis
  - ‚úÖ Implemented Redis-based stale detection that survives API server restarts
  - ‚úÖ Added comprehensive startup cleanup to remove legacy phantom data
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced periodic cleanup with Redis scanning for expired entries
- **Impact**: Monitor now shows **exactly what's actually running** - no more ghost machines
- **Files**: `apps/api/src/lightweight-api-server.ts:1569,1591,1869-2065,2984`

#### **SALAD PORT CONFLICT RESOLUTION - ComfyUI Restart Loop Fixed**  
- **Problem**: ComfyUI service stuck in infinite PM2 restart loop due to port 8188 conflicts on SALAD
- **Root Cause**: Process 4333 holding port, ComfyUI fails to start, PM2 restarts indefinitely
- **Solution**:
  - ‚úÖ Created aggressive port cleanup service that kills conflicting processes before service start
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced ComfyUIService to clear port conflicts instead of just failing
  - ‚úÖ Added PM2 restart limits and delays to prevent rapid restart loops
  - ‚úÖ Created standalone installer to optimize Docker layer caching
- **Impact**: SALAD deployments now start reliably without port conflicts
- **Files**: `apps/machine/src/services/port-cleanup-service.js`, `apps/machine/src/services/comfyui-service.js:126-148`, `apps/machine/scripts/pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs:12-15`

#### **DOCKER BUILD OPTIMIZATION - Custom Nodes Cache Performance**
- **Problem**: Docker builds reinstalled 64 custom nodes (30+ minutes) on every service code change
- **Solution**: 
  - ‚úÖ Created standalone custom nodes installer with minimal dependencies
  - ‚úÖ Reordered Dockerfile layers: installer ‚Üí custom nodes ‚Üí service code
  - ‚úÖ Eliminated dependency on frequently-changing `utils/logger.js`
- **Impact**: Build time reduced from 30+ minutes to ~2 minutes for service changes
