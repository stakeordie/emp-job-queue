# Modernization Initiative: Detailed TODO List

**Date**: 2025-08-25  
**Status**: Ready for Execution  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Timeline**: 4 Weeks  

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive modernization combining cleanup, API refactor, and EmProps integration. Tasks are sequenced for optimal execution with minimal risk and maximum efficiency.

## Sequencing Strategy

**Principles Applied**:
1. **Foundation First**: Cleanup enables everything else
2. **Test Early**: Add testing before major changes
3. **Incremental Risk**: Start with low-risk, build confidence
4. **Quick Wins**: Build momentum with visible improvements
5. **Dependencies Respected**: Prerequisites before dependents
6. **Production Safety**: Keep system operational throughout

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Points
Each phase has clear rollback capability:
1. **After Cleanup**: Can revert via git
2. **After Service Extraction**: Can revert to monolithic API
3. **After Database**: Can disable and use Redis only
4. **After EmProps**: Can run as separate service

### Testing Gates
Must pass before proceeding:
1. **Phase 1 Gate**: All tests passing, no TypeScript errors
2. **Phase 2 Gate**: Integration tests passing
3. **Phase 3 Gate**: EmProps + Job Queue working together
4. **Phase 4 Gate**: Load tests passing, security audit clean

### Daily Practices
