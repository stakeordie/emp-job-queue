# Redis Event Stream + Single Collector Container Architecture - Justification

**Date:** September 27, 2025
**Status:** Planning - Awaiting Implementation Decision
**Priority:** High - Critical for Development Productivity and Debugging
**Initiative:** Simplified Telemetry & Observability

## Executive Summary

The current emp-job-queue system lacks effective debugging capabilities across its 8 distributed services, leading to prolonged troubleshooting sessions when "something doesn't work." This document justifies implementing a Redis Event Stream-based telemetry architecture with a single collector container to solve immediate debugging pain points while providing a foundation for future observability needs.

## Problem Statement

### Current Debugging Reality
Our distributed system suffers from **observability blindness** during critical debugging scenarios:

**Scenario: "Job Stuck in Queue"**
- **Current Process**: Check 8 different log files across API, webhook, worker, machine services
- **Time to Resolution**: 30-60 minutes of manual log correlation
- **Frustration Level**: High - no unified view of event flow

**Scenario: "Machine Not Picking Up Jobs"**
- **Current Process**: SSH into machines, check PM2 logs, Redis CLI queries, manual timeline reconstruction
- **Time to Resolution**: 45-90 minutes for distributed race conditions
- **Knowledge Dependency**: Deep Redis and PM2 expertise required

**Scenario: "WebSocket Events Missing"**
- **Current Process**: Check API logs, webhook logs, browser network tab, manual event tracing
- **Time to Resolution**: 20-45 minutes to understand event flow breaks
- **Root Cause Opacity**: No visibility into which service dropped the event

### Technical Pain Points

#### 1. **Distributed Log Archaeology**
```bash
# Current debugging workflow (manual and painful)
tail -f apps/api/logs/dev.log &           # API events
docker logs basic-machine-local -f &      # Machine events
tail -f apps/webhook-service/logs/*.log & # Webhook events
redis-cli monitor &                       # Redis operations

# Result: 4 terminal windows, manual correlation, missed events
```

#### 2. **Event Flow Invisibility**
- **No Timeline View**: Can't see "Job Created → Worker Claimed → ComfyUI Started → Progress Updates → Completion"
- **Missing Context**: Logs show isolated events without causal relationships
- **Race Condition Blindness**: Concurrent operations obscure actual event ordering

#### 3. **Memory Pressure Locally**
```bash
# Current local development resource usage
API Server:          ~150MB (logs + Redis connections)
Webhook Service:     ~120MB (logs + WebSocket management)
Monitor UI:          ~100MB (React dev server)
Worker:              ~200MB (connector management)
Machine Container:   ~800MB (ComfyUI + dependencies)
Basic Machine:       ~300MB (PM2 + service management)
Redis:               ~50MB
Local Development:   ~200MB (hot reload + bundling)

Total: ~1.92GB (approaching memory limits on smaller development machines)
```

#### 4. **OpenTelemetry/Dash0 Value Gap**
Previous attempt at comprehensive telemetry infrastructure created overhead without solving core debugging needs:
- **Over-Engineering**: Full distributed tracing for simple local debugging
- **Complexity Burden**: OTEL collector configuration, endpoint management, credential handling
- **Delayed Feedback**: Dash0 dashboard latency vs. immediate debugging needs
- **Value Mismatch**: Enterprise observability tools for development-phase debugging

### Development Workflow Impact

#### Time Lost to "Mystery Debugging"
- **Daily Debugging Sessions**: 2-3 incidents requiring cross-service investigation
- **Average Resolution Time**: 45 minutes per incident
- **Weekly Lost Productivity**: 4-6 hours of manual log correlation
- **Context Switching Cost**: Breaking development flow for forensic investigation

#### Knowledge Bottlenecks
- **Redis Function Debugging**: Requires deep understanding of Lua script execution
- **PM2 Service States**: Complex service dependency management
- **WebSocket Event Flow**: Browser-to-backend event correlation complexity
- **Job State Transitions**: Understanding Redis-based job lifecycle

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### Core Philosophy: "Simple Add Event Anywhere"

**Developer Experience Goal:**
```typescript
// Any service, any location - simple event emission
telemetry.event('job.created', { jobId: 'job_123', userId: 'user_456' });
telemetry.event('worker.claimed_job', { jobId: 'job_123', workerId: 'worker_789' });
telemetry.event('comfyui.workflow_started', { jobId: 'job_123', nodeCount: 15 });
telemetry.event('job.completed', { jobId: 'job_123', duration: 45000 });
```

**Debugging Experience Goal:**
```bash
# Single command to see entire event timeline
pnpm debug:events --filter="jobId:job_123"

# Real-time event stream for active debugging
pnpm debug:stream --live

# Service-specific event filtering
pnpm debug:events --service=worker --last=1h
```

### Technical Architecture

#### 1. **Redis Streams as Event Backbone**
**Location:** Existing Redis instance (no additional infrastructure)

```typescript
// Event emission to Redis Stream
interface TelemetryEvent {
  timestamp: number;
  service: string;
  eventType: string;
  jobId?: string;
  workerId?: string;
  machineId?: string;
  data: Record<string, any>;
  traceId: string; // for correlation
}

// Redis Stream: emp:events
// Automatic partitioning by service type
await redis.xadd('emp:events', '*', {
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  service: 'api-server',
  eventType: 'job.created',
  jobId: 'job_123',
  data: JSON.stringify({ priority: 'high', model: 'flux-1' })
});
```

**Benefits:**
- **Zero Additional Infrastructure**: Uses existing Redis
- **Built-in Persistence**: Redis Streams automatically persist events
- **Atomic Operations**: Event emission never blocks service operation
- **Natural Ordering**: Redis Streams maintain chronological order
- **Memory Efficient**: Configurable retention (keep last 10,000 events)

#### 2. **Single Collector Container**
**Location:** `apps/telemetry-collector/`

```dockerfile
# Lightweight Node.js container
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install --production
COPY src/ ./src/
CMD ["node", "src/collector.js"]

# Resource usage: ~30MB (vs 150MB+ for OTEL collector)
```

**Responsibilities:**
- **Event Stream Reading**: Continuous Redis Stream consumption
- **Event Buffering**: Batch events for efficient Dash0 forwarding
- **Format Translation**: Convert Redis events to OpenTelemetry format
- **Connection Management**: Single Dash0 connection point
- **Local Development Mode**: File-based event logging for offline debugging

#### 3. **Lightweight Event Client**
**Location:** `packages/core/src/telemetry/event-client.ts`

```typescript
class EventClient {
  constructor(serviceName: string) {
    this.serviceName = serviceName;
    this.redis = getRedisConnection();
  }

  // Fire-and-forget event emission (never blocks)
  async event(type: string, data: Record<string, any> = {}): Promise<void> {
    try {
      await this.redis.xadd('emp:events', '*', {
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        service: this.serviceName,
        eventType: type,
        traceId: this.getTraceId(),
        data: JSON.stringify(data)
      });
    } catch (error) {
      // Silent failure - never break service operation
      console.warn(`Telemetry event failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }

  // Context-aware event emission
  async jobEvent(jobId: string, type: string, data: Record<string, any> = {}): Promise<void> {
    return this.event(type, { jobId, ...data });
  }

  async workerEvent(workerId: string, type: string, data: Record<string, any> = {}): Promise<void> {
    return this.event(type, { workerId, ...data });
  }
}

// Service-specific instances
export const apiTelemetry = new EventClient('api-server');
export const workerTelemetry = new EventClient('worker');
export const machineTelemetry = new EventClient('machine');
```

### 4. **Development Debugging Tools**
**Location:** `tools/debug-events/`

```bash
# Real-time event stream monitoring
pnpm debug:events:stream

# Historical event analysis
pnpm debug:events:search --jobId="job_123" --timespan="last 1h"

# Service health monitoring
pnpm debug:events:health --services="api,worker,machine"

# Event flow visualization (ASCII timeline)
pnpm debug:events:timeline --jobId="job_123"
```

## Justification Analysis

### Why This Approach vs. Alternatives

#### Alternative 1: Enhanced Logging
**Rejected Reasons:**
- **Still Distributed**: Doesn't solve log correlation problem
- **Storage Overhead**: Log files grow indefinitely locally
- **No Structure**: Unstructured logs difficult to query and correlate
- **Manual Correlation**: Still requires manual timeline reconstruction

#### Alternative 2: Full OpenTelemetry + Sidecar Pattern
**Rejected Reasons:**
- **Resource Overhead**: 8 sidecar containers = ~400MB additional memory
- **Configuration Complexity**: 8 OTEL configurations to maintain
- **Over-Engineering**: Enterprise-grade solution for development debugging
- **Network Overhead**: Additional container-to-container communication

#### Alternative 3: Centralized Logging (ELK/Grafana)
**Rejected Reasons:**
- **Infrastructure Overhead**: Requires Elasticsearch/Grafana containers locally
- **Setup Complexity**: Complex local development environment
- **Memory Impact**: ES container alone requires 1GB+ memory
- **Value Mismatch**: Production logging stack for development debugging

### Why Redis Event Stream + Single Collector Wins

#### 1. **Minimal Resource Footprint**
```
Current Memory Usage:          1.92GB
Additional Overhead:           +30MB (collector only)
Total Memory Usage:            1.95GB (1.5% increase)

vs. Sidecar Pattern:          +400MB (20% increase)
vs. ELK Stack:                +1GB+ (50%+ increase)
```

#### 2. **Zero Service Impact**
- **Non-Blocking**: Event emission never delays service operations
- **Fire-and-Forget**: Services continue if telemetry fails
- **No Configuration**: Services require zero telemetry configuration
- **Gradual Adoption**: Can add events incrementally without system changes

#### 3. **Immediate Developer Value**
- **Real-time Debugging**: Events visible immediately during development
- **Historical Analysis**: Query past events for post-mortem analysis
- **Timeline Visualization**: See exact event ordering across services
- **Context Preservation**: Events carry job/worker/machine correlation IDs

#### 4. **Future-Proof Foundation**
- **Dash0 Ready**: Collector can forward to Dash0 when valuable
- **OpenTelemetry Compatible**: Events translate to OTEL format
- **Scalable**: Redis Streams handle production event volumes
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new event types and debugging tools

### Addressing Concerns

#### Concern: "Another Moving Part"
**Response:** Single container vs. 8 sidecar containers is net simplification
- **Operational Complexity**: 1 collector vs. 8 OTEL sidecars
- **Configuration Points**: 1 collector config vs. 8 service configs
- **Debugging Surface**: Single event stream vs. distributed traces

#### Concern: "Redis as Event Store"
**Response:** Redis Streams are purpose-built for event streaming
- **Battle-Tested**: Redis Streams used in production by major systems
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond event emission latency
- **Persistence**: Configurable retention with automatic cleanup
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Zero additional database dependencies

#### Concern: "Development vs. Production Mismatch"
**Response:** Architecture scales from development to production
- **Development**: File-based event logs + Redis Streams locally
- **Production**: Same events forwarded to Dash0 via collector
- **Consistent API**: Same `telemetry.event()` calls in all environments
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Collector can run as sidecar or service in production
