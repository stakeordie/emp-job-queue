# Running in Production

This section covers everything needed to operate the system in production environments.

## Production Reality

Running distributed AI workloads in production means dealing with:
- **Ephemeral infrastructure** that disappears without warning
- **Heterogeneous hardware** with varying capabilities
- **Network partitions** and connectivity issues
- **Resource constraints** and cost optimization

## In This Section

- [Failure Handling](./failure-handling.md) - Comprehensive failure scenarios and recovery
- [Machine Logs Analysis](./machine-logs-analysis.md) - Understanding production logs
- [Deployment Strategies](./deployment-strategies.md) - How to deploy at scale *(to be written)*
- [Monitoring & Alerting](./monitoring-alerting.md) - Keeping the system healthy *(to be written)*
- [Performance Tuning](./performance-tuning.md) - Optimization strategies *(from North Star)*
- [Capacity Planning](./capacity-planning.md) - Resource forecasting *(to be written)*

## Production Checklist

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Redis cluster configured with persistence
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards set up
- [ ] Alert thresholds configured
- [ ] Backup procedures in place
- [ ] Failure recovery tested

### Operational Procedures
- **Daily**: Check system health, review error rates
- **Weekly**: Analyze performance trends, capacity planning
- **Monthly**: Cost optimization review, architecture assessment

## Key Production Insights

1. **Machines will fail** - Design for failure, not prevention
2. **Jobs must be idempotent** - They may be retried multiple times
3. **Monitor everything** - You can't fix what you can't see
4. **Cost matters** - Optimize for cost-per-job, not just performance

## Common Production Issues

### Machine Churn
- Machines disappearing mid-job
- Solution: Automatic job redistribution

### Resource Exhaustion
- Running out of GPU memory or disk space
- Solution: Resource monitoring and limits

### Network Issues
- Redis connection failures
- Solution: Retry logic and circuit breakers
