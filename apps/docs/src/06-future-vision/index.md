# Future Vision

This section outlines where the system is heading based on our North Star architecture and strategic plans.

## North Star: Specialized Machine Pools

We're evolving from uniform machines to specialized pools optimized for different workload patterns:

## Key Future Capabilities

### Phase 1: Pool Separation (Next 2 months)
- Separate fast/standard/heavy workload pools
- Pool-specific machine configurations
- Basic affinity routing

### Phase 2: Model Intelligence (Months 3-4)
- Predictive model placement
- Model usage analytics
- Proactive model caching

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (Months 5-6)
- ML-based demand prediction
- Cross-pool optimization
- Automatic capacity planning

## What This Enables

### For the Business
- **10x scale capacity** without 10x cost
- **Sub-10 second response** for 95% of jobs
- **Predictable performance** across workload types

### For Operations
- **Automated scaling** based on workload patterns
- **Smart resource allocation** reducing waste
- **Proactive problem prevention** via prediction

### For Users
- **Faster job completion** through optimal routing
- **Higher reliability** with specialized pools
- **Better cost efficiency** passed through

## Technical Challenges

1. **Pool Coordination** - Managing multiple pools efficiently
2. **Model Prediction** - Accurately predicting model needs
3. **Cost Optimization** - Balancing performance and cost
4. **Migration Path** - Moving from current to target state

## Success Metrics

- **Pool Utilization**: >80% for each pool type
- **Model Cache Hits**: >90% for popular models
- **Job Routing Accuracy**: >95% to optimal pool
- **Cost per Job**: 50% reduction from current

## Getting Involved

This future vision requires collaboration across:
- **Engineering**: Building the pool infrastructure
- **Data Science**: Creating prediction models
- **Operations**: Managing complex deployments
- **Product**: Defining user experience
