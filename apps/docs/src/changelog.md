### ✅ Completed - Workflow-Aware Job Prioritization System

#### 🎯 **Priority Logic Implementation**
- **Problem**: Job sorting was inconsistent between API server and JobBroker
- **Solution**: Unified workflow-aware scoring across all components
- **Priority Order**: `workflow_priority` > `job.priority` → `workflow_datetime` > `created_at`

#### 📊 **Scoring Formula**
```javascript
// NEW: Workflow-aware scoring with TRUE FIFO (older jobs first)
const effectivePriority = job.workflow_priority || job.priority;
const effectiveDateTime = job.workflow_datetime || Date.parse(job.created_at);  
const score = effectivePriority * 1000000 + (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER - effectiveDateTime);

// OLD: Simple job-level scoring (inconsistent LIFO)
const score = job.priority * 1000 + Date.now(); // WRONG: newer jobs first
```

#### 🔧 **Components Updated**
- **API Server**: `lightweight-api-server.ts` - Job submission scoring
- **Redis Service**: `redis-service.ts` - All job queue operations (5 locations)
- **Worker Client**: `redis-direct-worker-client.ts` - Job retry logic
- **Result**: All job queue operations now use consistent workflow-aware prioritization

#### ✅ **Test Results**
```
Workflow Priority Test:
1. workflow_priority: 200 → Selected FIRST (beats job priority 100)
2. workflow_priority: 150 → Selected SECOND  
3. job.priority: 100 → Selected THIRD (no workflow)
4. job.priority: 75 → Selected FOURTH (no workflow)

FIFO Test (same priority):
1. Older standalone job (earlier created_at) → Selected FIRST ✅
2. Newer workflow job (later workflow_datetime) → Selected SECOND ✅
```

#### 🎯 **Benefits**
- **Workflow Consistency**: Related jobs stay together in priority order
- **FIFO within Priority**: Older workflows/jobs processed first within same priority
- **Backward Compatible**: Jobs without workflow info use job-level priority/datetime
- **Redis Function Ready**: Orchestration system gets properly prioritized jobs

### ✅ Completed - Next.js Monitor Complete Implementation & Fixes
- **Fixed stats_broadcast Message Parsing**: Critical fix for worker and job data display
  - **Problem**: Workers carousel and job queue showing "No workers/jobs" despite hub connection
  - **Root Cause**: stats_broadcast message structure uses object format (workers as {id: data}) not arrays
  - **Solution**: Updated store to handle `message.workers` as object and `message.system.jobs.*_jobs` arrays
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/store/index.ts`: Fixed stats_broadcast parsing with proper type assertions
    - `src/types/job.ts`: Added 'processing' to JobStatus type

  - **Root Cause**: Missing call to connection manager's message routing in websocket-manager.ts
  - **Solution**: Added `forwardMessage()` method to ConnectionManager interface and implementation
  - **Files Fixed**:
    - `src/core/interfaces/connection-manager.ts`: Added forwardMessage method to interface
    - `src/core/connection-manager.ts`: Added public forwardMessage method
    - `src/hub/websocket-manager.ts`: Added message forwarding to connection manager
  - **Impact**: All WebSocket messages (including workflow submissions) now properly processed
  - **Enables**: Monitor workflow simulation and job submission now functional

## 2024-06-30

### ✅ Completed - Session 12 (Multi-GPU Architecture & Docker Integration Testing)
- **Comprehensive Integration Testing Infrastructure**: Created complete Docker-based testing environment
  - **Multi-GPU Server Architecture**: Implemented proper 1 container = 1 GPU server with multiple workers (1 worker per GPU)
  - **Realistic Worker Spawning**: Each GPU server can spawn multiple workers bound to specific GPUs and services
  - **Mock AI Services**: ComfyUI, A1111, and Flux mock services with realistic processing times for testing
  - **Isolated Test Environment**: Docker Compose setup with Redis, Hub, and 4 GPU servers (15 total workers)
  - **Production-like Testing**: Tests actual WebSocket connections, job routing, and concurrent processing
- **Unworkable Job Detection System**: Enhanced job broker to handle jobs no workers can process
  - **Problem Solved**: Jobs requiring unavailable services now marked as "unworkable" instead of stuck in queue
  - **User Visibility**: Users can see which jobs can't be processed and make decisions about canceling/modifying
  - **Automatic Detection**: `markUnworkableJobs()` scans pending jobs and moves unworkable ones to separate queue
  - **Requeue Capability**: `requeueUnworkableJob()` allows jobs to be retried when worker capabilities change
  - **Status Tracking**: Added `JobStatus.UNWORKABLE` for proper job lifecycle management
- **Mock Worker Simulation**: Created realistic job processing simulation for fast, reliable tests
  - **Instant Processing**: Workers simulate job completion without waiting for actual AI generation
  - **Proper Status Updates**: Jobs properly transition through assigned → in_progress → completed states
  - **Worker Assignment Tracking**: Full tracking of which workers handle which jobs with capabilities verification

### 🏗️ Multi-GPU Server Architecture
- **Container = GPU Server**: Each Docker container represents one physical machine with multiple GPUs
- **Worker per GPU**: Each GPU gets its own worker instance with dedicated service bindings
- **Service-GPU Binding**: Services (ComfyUI, A1111, Flux) are bound to specific GPUs within a server
- **Realistic Hardware Configs**: 
  - GPU Server 1: 4x RTX 4090 (mixed services per GPU)
  - GPU Server 2: 2x RTX 3080 (hybrid capabilities)
  - GPU Server 3: 1x GTX 1660 (budget with customer restrictions)
  - GPU Server 4: 8x H100 (enterprise high-capacity setup)
- **Production-Ready Testing**: Tests validate job routing to correct GPU workers based on service requirements

### 🔧 Enhanced Job Broker Features
- **Capability-based Job Routing**: Jobs automatically routed to workers with matching service and hardware capabilities
- **Customer Isolation Enforcement**: Strict customer access controls tested with restricted workers
- **Hardware Requirement Matching**: GPU memory and compute requirements properly validated
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple workers can process jobs simultaneously across different GPUs
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Atomic job claiming ensures no double-assignment in concurrent scenarios

### ✅ Completed - Session 11 (Worker Status & Job Completion Fixes)
- **Fixed Worker Status Persistence**: Resolved critical issue where workers weren't returning to idle state after completing jobs
  - **Problem**: `updateWorkerStatus` method in RedisService was just a stub that did nothing
  - **Solution**: Implemented full `updateWorkerStatus` method to properly update worker status and `current_job_id` in Redis
  - **Worker Status Communication**: Added `sendStatusUpdate` method to WorkerClient for immediate status notifications
  - **Job Lifecycle Tracking**: Workers now notify hub when transitioning from busy→idle and idle→busy states
  - **Current Job ID Management**: Worker `current_job_id` is properly set when starting jobs and cleared when completing
- **Enhanced Job Completion Flow**: Fixed message handlers to properly clear worker status on job completion/failure
  - **Job Complete Handler**: Now calls `updateWorkerStatus(workerId, IDLE, [])` to clear current job
  - **Job Failed Handler**: Similarly clears worker status and current job assignment
  - **Status Notifications**: Workers proactively notify hub of status changes rather than waiting for heartbeat
- **Worker State Synchronization**: Ensured local worker status stays synchronized with Redis state
  - **Job Start Notifications**: Workers notify hub when starting to process jobs
  - **Job End Notifications**: Workers notify hub immediately when jobs complete/fail/timeout
  - **Real-time Updates**: Status changes communicated via WebSocket for immediate hub awareness

### ✅ Completed - Session 10 (Monitor State Management & Disconnect Fixes)
- **Fixed Monitor Queue State Management**: Resolved critical issue where monitor couldn't properly track job states
  - **Problem**: Monitor was only looking at `system.jobs.active_jobs` but new system splits jobs into separate arrays (`pending_jobs`, `active_jobs`, `completed_jobs`, `failed_jobs`)
  - **Solution**: Updated monitor to process all job arrays and maintain backward compatibility with old format
  - **Fixed Worker Status**: Workers now properly show `current_job_id` in stats broadcasts when processing jobs
  - **Fixed Job Counting**: Monitor now correctly counts queued and active jobs from proper data sources
  - **Added Status Mapping**: Monitor now recognizes 'assigned' status as active (new system uses 'assigned' instead of 'active')
- **Enhanced Monitor Disconnect Handling**: Fixed aggressive disconnect behavior that was causing connection issues
  - **Problem**: When either monitor OR client socket failed, both connections would disconnect and clear all data
  - **Solution**: Implemented individual socket disconnect handlers (`handleMonitorDisconnect`, `handleClientDisconnect`)
  - **Selective Data Clearing**: Data only clears when BOTH connections are down, not when just one fails
  - **Independent Connections**: Monitor and client sockets now fail independently for better resilience

### 🔧 Connection Manager Stats Broadcast Fixes
- **Worker Current Job ID**: Fixed hardcoded `undefined` to fetch actual job assignments from Redis
- **Worker Status Logic**: Workers now show 'working' when they have a job, 'idle' when they don't
- **Backward Compatibility**: Added unified `active_jobs` array containing all jobs for monitor compatibility
- **Job-to-Worker Mapping**: Enhanced stats generation to map active jobs to workers by `worker_id`

### 🔧 Monitor Processing Improvements  
- **Unified Job Processing**: Monitor now processes all job types (pending, active, completed, failed) in single pass
- **Status Recognition**: Added support for 'assigned' job status from new system
- **Removed Duplicate Processing**: Eliminated redundant job array processing sections
- **Enhanced Job Filtering**: Improved job categorization for accurate counts and display

  - Added comprehensive capability self-assessment before claiming jobs (hardware, customer access, service matching)
  - Built job timeout handling with automatic job release and connector cancellation
  - Added cleanup mechanisms for job tracking, timeouts, and worker status management

### 🔧 Production-Ready Worker Features
- **Retry Logic**: Workers retry failed job claims up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **Timeout Management**: Jobs automatically timeout and get released back to queue for retry
- **Enhanced Capability Matching**: Workers assess hardware requirements, customer access rules, and service compatibility
- **Conflict Resolution**: Atomic job claiming prevents multiple workers from claiming the same job
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of job timeouts, tracking data, and worker status on completion/failure
- **JobBroker Integration**: Uses workflow-aware JobBroker for sophisticated job selection over basic Redis queries

### 🎯 Core Job Processing Complete
