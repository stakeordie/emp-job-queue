  - **Production-like Testing**: Tests actual WebSocket connections, job routing, and concurrent processing
- **Unworkable Job Detection System**: Enhanced job broker to handle jobs no workers can process
  - **Problem Solved**: Jobs requiring unavailable services now marked as "unworkable" instead of stuck in queue
  - **User Visibility**: Users can see which jobs can't be processed and make decisions about canceling/modifying
  - **Automatic Detection**: `markUnworkableJobs()` scans pending jobs and moves unworkable ones to separate queue
  - **Requeue Capability**: `requeueUnworkableJob()` allows jobs to be retried when worker capabilities change
  - **Status Tracking**: Added `JobStatus.UNWORKABLE` for proper job lifecycle management
- **Mock Worker Simulation**: Created realistic job processing simulation for fast, reliable tests
  - **Instant Processing**: Workers simulate job completion without waiting for actual AI generation
  - **Proper Status Updates**: Jobs properly transition through assigned → in_progress → completed states
  - **Worker Assignment Tracking**: Full tracking of which workers handle which jobs with capabilities verification

### 🏗️ Multi-GPU Server Architecture
- **Container = GPU Server**: Each Docker container represents one physical machine with multiple GPUs
- **Worker per GPU**: Each GPU gets its own worker instance with dedicated service bindings
- **Service-GPU Binding**: Services (ComfyUI, A1111, Flux) are bound to specific GPUs within a server
- **Realistic Hardware Configs**: 
  - GPU Server 1: 4x RTX 4090 (mixed services per GPU)
  - GPU Server 2: 2x RTX 3080 (hybrid capabilities)
  - GPU Server 3: 1x GTX 1660 (budget with customer restrictions)

  - **Problem**: `updateWorkerStatus` method in RedisService was just a stub that did nothing
  - **Solution**: Implemented full `updateWorkerStatus` method to properly update worker status and `current_job_id` in Redis
  - **Worker Status Communication**: Added `sendStatusUpdate` method to WorkerClient for immediate status notifications
  - **Job Lifecycle Tracking**: Workers now notify hub when transitioning from busy→idle and idle→busy states
  - **Current Job ID Management**: Worker `current_job_id` is properly set when starting jobs and cleared when completing
- **Enhanced Job Completion Flow**: Fixed message handlers to properly clear worker status on job completion/failure
  - **Job Complete Handler**: Now calls `updateWorkerStatus(workerId, IDLE, [])` to clear current job
  - **Job Failed Handler**: Similarly clears worker status and current job assignment
  - **Status Notifications**: Workers proactively notify hub of status changes rather than waiting for heartbeat
- **Worker State Synchronization**: Ensured local worker status stays synchronized with Redis state
  - **Job Start Notifications**: Workers notify hub when starting to process jobs
  - **Job End Notifications**: Workers notify hub immediately when jobs complete/fail/timeout
  - **Real-time Updates**: Status changes communicated via WebSocket for immediate hub awareness

### ✅ Completed - Session 10 (Monitor State Management & Disconnect Fixes)
- **Fixed Monitor Queue State Management**: Resolved critical issue where monitor couldn't properly track job states
  - **Problem**: Monitor was only looking at `system.jobs.active_jobs` but new system splits jobs into separate arrays (`pending_jobs`, `active_jobs`, `completed_jobs`, `failed_jobs`)
  - **Solution**: Updated monitor to process all job arrays and maintain backward compatibility with old format
  - **Fixed Worker Status**: Workers now properly show `current_job_id` in stats broadcasts when processing jobs
  - **Fixed Job Counting**: Monitor now correctly counts queued and active jobs from proper data sources
  - **Added Status Mapping**: Monitor now recognizes 'assigned' status as active (new system uses 'assigned' instead of 'active')
- **Enhanced Monitor Disconnect Handling**: Fixed aggressive disconnect behavior that was causing connection issues
  - **Problem**: When either monitor OR client socket failed, both connections would disconnect and clear all data
  - **Solution**: Implemented individual socket disconnect handlers (`handleMonitorDisconnect`, `handleClientDisconnect`)
  - **Selective Data Clearing**: Data only clears when BOTH connections are down, not when just one fails
  - **Independent Connections**: Monitor and client sockets now fail independently for better resilience

### 🔧 Connection Manager Stats Broadcast Fixes
- **Worker Current Job ID**: Fixed hardcoded `undefined` to fetch actual job assignments from Redis
- **Worker Status Logic**: Workers now show 'working' when they have a job, 'idle' when they don't
- **Backward Compatibility**: Added unified `active_jobs` array containing all jobs for monitor compatibility
- **Job-to-Worker Mapping**: Enhanced stats generation to map active jobs to workers by `worker_id`

### 🔧 Monitor Processing Improvements

  - Added comprehensive capability self-assessment before claiming jobs (hardware, customer access, service matching)
  - Built job timeout handling with automatic job release and connector cancellation
  - Added cleanup mechanisms for job tracking, timeouts, and worker status management

### 🔧 Production-Ready Worker Features
- **Retry Logic**: Workers retry failed job claims up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **Timeout Management**: Jobs automatically timeout and get released back to queue for retry
- **Enhanced Capability Matching**: Workers assess hardware requirements, customer access rules, and service compatibility
- **Conflict Resolution**: Atomic job claiming prevents multiple workers from claiming the same job

- **Coverage Goals**: 95% for job broker core, 90% for message handler, 80% overall
- **Performance Benchmarks**: 1000+ jobs/second, <100ms matching, <50ms API response

### 🚧 Ready for Implementation
- **Core Logic Priority**: Job Broker implementation (priority + FIFO job selection) - **WITH COMPREHENSIVE TESTS**
- **Message Processing**: Complete 30+ message type handlers - **WITH VALIDATION TESTS**
- **Worker Logic**: Pull-based claiming with conflict resolution - **WITH CONCURRENCY TESTS**

### ✅ Completed - Session 2
- **Documentation System**: Fixed VitePress ESM compatibility issues with Mermaid plugin
  - Resolved DayJS and @braintree/sanitize-url module export errors
  - Updated Vite configuration for proper dependency optimization
  - Added missing dependencies for Mermaid rendering
- **Interactive Diagrams**: Enhanced all Mermaid diagrams with zoom/pan functionality
  - Wrapped all diagrams in FullscreenDiagram component
  - Extended zoom range to 5%-300% for better diagram viewing
  - Added expand button, zoom controls, and pan functionality
- **Changelog Integration**: Made changelog the official development record
  - Moved from `/tasks/CHANGELOG.md` to `/apps/docs/src/changelog.md`
  - Added to VitePress navigation and sidebar
  - Updated CLAUDE.md to enforce changelog updates before commits

## 2024-06-30

### ✅ Completed
- **Interface Consolidation**: Removed duplicate `JobRequirements` and `WorkerCapabilities` definitions across files
- **Workflow Filtering**: Added 3-level job filtering (service → component → workflow) for EmProps architecture
- **Type Safety**: Fixed all TypeScript errors and ESLint warnings (71 → 0)
- **Documentation Setup**: Added VitePress documentation app with EmProps branding
- **Task Organization**: Created backlog/in_progress/complete structure for todo tracking
- **Python System Audit**: Comprehensive analysis of missing features vs Python emp-redis

### 🏗️ Architecture Changes
- **Unified Interfaces**: Established canonical locations for all type definitions
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Jobs only need `service_type`, can optionally add `component`/`workflow`
- **GPU Architecture**: Removed `gpu_count` - enforcing 1 worker per GPU model
- **Union Types**: Added `"all"` support for future hardware/model filtering

### 📊 Current Status
- **Type Safety**: 100% (0 TypeScript errors, 0 ESLint warnings)
- **Feature Completeness**: ~30% (infrastructure complete, core logic missing)
- **Production Ready**: 20% (development environment functional)

### 🎯 Next High Priority
1. **Job Broker Core Logic** - Implement Redis-based job selection and priority queues
2. **Message Processing** - Complete all 30+ message type handlers
3. **Worker Job Selection** - Build pull-based claiming with timeouts/retries

### 🔍 Key Findings from Python Audit
- **Missing Critical**: Job selection algorithm, message broadcasting, capability matching
- **Architecture Advantage**: Better type safety, cleaner separation of concerns
- **Implementation Gap**: ~70% of core job processing logic needs porting
