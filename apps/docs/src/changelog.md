# EmProps Job Queue Development Changelog

## 2024-06-30

### ✅ Completed - Session 8 (Python Message Format Compatibility)
- **Critical Message Format Fixes**: Updated TypeScript message interfaces to match Python exactly
  - **CompleteJobMessage**: Added missing required `worker_id` field (was causing Python compatibility failures)
  - **FailJobMessage**: Made `error` field optional to match Python format
  - **ServiceRequestMessage**: Fixed field names to match Python: `service` (not `service_type`), `request_type`, `content` (not `payload`)
  - **UpdateJobProgressMessage**: Added missing `client_id` field present in Python messages
  - **ResponseJobStatusMessage**: Added missing `client_id` field present in Python messages
  - Updated message handlers to use correct `worker_id` field instead of `message.source`
  - Enhanced error handling for optional fields in FailJobMessage

### 🔧 Python Compatibility Achieved
- **Problem Solved**: TypeScript messages now have 100% field compatibility with Python emp-redis
- **Based on Real Messages**: Used actual Python message payloads to identify and fix format discrepancies
- **Critical for Integration**: Enables seamless communication between TypeScript and Python systems
- **Worker Completion**: Workers can now send `complete_job` messages that Python hub will accept

### ✅ Completed - Session 7 (Monitor Workflow Tracking)
- **Complete Monitor Workflow Data**: Enhanced connection-manager to send ALL workflow tracking data to monitors
  - Fixed critical gap where workflow information (workflow_id, workflow_priority, workflow_datetime, step_number) was missing from monitor displays
  - Updated pending jobs, completed jobs, and failed jobs mappings to include all workflow fields
  - Active jobs already included workflow tracking (from previous session)
  - Monitor now receives complete workflow visibility for job tracking across all job states
  - Enables full workflow step tracking and analysis in monitor interface

### 🔧 Monitor Workflow Visibility
- **Problem Solved**: Monitor now receives complete workflow metadata for all job states (pending, active, completed, failed)
- **Critical for Operations**: Full workflow tracking enables step-by-step job monitoring and workflow analysis
- **Backwards Compatible**: Non-workflow jobs continue to work normally with undefined workflow fields

### ✅ Completed - Session 4 (Monitor Fixes & Responsiveness)
- **Fixed Worker Status Display**: Workers now correctly show as "Active" when processing jobs
  - Workers are marked as 'busy' when they receive job assignments
  - Stats broadcast no longer clears busy status for workers with active jobs
  - Enhanced status preservation logic in handleStatsBroadcast() and handleJobProgress()
  - Added debug logging to track worker status transitions
- **Improved Monitor Responsiveness**: Reduced stats broadcast interval from 5s to 2s
  - Updated STATS_BROADCAST_INTERVAL_MS=2000 in all environment files
  - Modified .env.example, .env.production, and .env.hub.example
  - Monitor now updates worker and job status 2.5x faster
- **Enhanced Worker State Management**: Better job assignment and completion tracking
  - Workers automatically marked as busy during job progress updates
  - Proper status cleanup when jobs complete
  - Fixed race conditions between stats broadcasts and worker status updates

### 🔧 Monitor Improvements
- **Real-time Status**: Workers show accurate busy/idle status during job processing
- **Faster Updates**: 2-second update interval for better user experience
- **Debug Logging**: Enhanced console logging for troubleshooting worker status issues
- **State Consistency**: Improved state preservation across stats broadcast cycles
- **Fixed Timestamp Display**: Updated formatDateTime() to handle new millisecond timestamp format
  - Removed incorrect seconds-to-milliseconds conversion that caused "Invalid Date"
  - Jobs now show correct creation times in monitor interface
- **Revolutionary Combined Overview**: Redesigned stats and workers into single horizontal card with carousel
  - **Streamlined Stats**: Removed redundant stats, kept only Queued and Active job counts
  - **Integrated Counters**: Added worker count to "Connected Workers" title, removed separate stat
  - **Smart Client Display**: Shows client count next to connection status "(X other clients connected)"
  - **Job Section Totals**: Added total counts to "All Jobs (X)" and "Finished Jobs (X)" headers  
  - **Removed History Link**: Eliminated unused history stat to save space
  - **Compact Design**: Stats section now much smaller, giving more space to workers carousel
  - **Horizontal Workers Carousel**: Workers display as scrollable cards with navigation arrows
  - **Responsive Layout**: Stacks vertically on mobile, maintains horizontal efficiency on desktop

### ✅ Completed - Session 6 (Enhanced Message Processing System)
- **Flexible Message Processing**: Implemented EnhancedMessageHandler with dynamic handler registration
  - Dynamic handler registration system for custom message types
  - Support for overriding default handlers with custom implementations
  - Graceful handling of unknown message types with error responses
  - Message context tracking (worker/client source identification)
  - Comprehensive event callback system for message lifecycle events
  - Message statistics tracking with type-specific counters and performance metrics
  - Thread-safe message routing with proper error handling and recovery

### 🔧 Message System Features
- **Handler Registration**: `registerHandler(type, handler)` for custom message types
- **Runtime Extensibility**: Add new message types without code changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy MessageHandler still supported with stub implementations

### ✅ Completed - Session 5 (Job Broker Core Implementation)
- **Job Broker Core Logic**: Implemented complete workflow priority inheritance system
  - Enhanced Job and JobSubmissionRequest interfaces with workflow fields (workflow_id, workflow_priority, workflow_datetime, step_number)
  - Created JobBroker class with pull-based job selection algorithm
  - Implemented workflow-based scoring: priority * 1000000 + workflowDatetime for proper job ordering
  - Added workflow metadata storage and retrieval with Redis TTL management
  - Enhanced job claiming with race condition protection and capability matching
  - Built comprehensive queue management (position, depth, statistics)
  - Added WorkflowMetadata interface for tracking workflow state and progress

### 🔧 Workflow Priority Inheritance
- **Problem Solved**: Workflow steps now stay grouped together in queue instead of being interleaved
- **Algorithm**: Jobs inherit workflowDateTime from original workflow submission timestamp
- **Score Calculation**: Ensures A-step2 processes before B-step1 when A was submitted first
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing single jobs continue to work without workflow_id

- **GPU Architecture**: Removed `gpu_count` - enforcing 1 worker per GPU model
- **Union Types**: Added `"all"` support for future hardware/model filtering

### 📊 Current Status
- **Type Safety**: 100% (0 TypeScript errors, 0 ESLint warnings)
- **Feature Completeness**: ~30% (infrastructure complete, core logic missing)
- **Production Ready**: 20% (development environment functional)

### 🎯 Next High Priority
1. **Job Broker Core Logic** - Implement Redis-based job selection and priority queues
2. **Message Processing** - Complete all 30+ message type handlers
3. **Worker Job Selection** - Build pull-based claiming with timeouts/retries

### 🔍 Key Findings from Python Audit
- **Missing Critical**: Job selection algorithm, message broadcasting, capability matching
- **Architecture Advantage**: Better type safety, cleaner separation of concerns
- **Implementation Gap**: ~70% of core job processing logic needs porting
