# Prompt Library

This section tracks prompts used throughout the development process, including timestamps, context, and outcomes. This helps us understand work progression, improve prompting techniques, and maintain continuity across sessions.

## Purpose

- **Track Intent**: Document what we're trying to achieve with each prompt
- **Learn Patterns**: Identify which prompt structures work best
- **Maintain Context**: Preserve important context across sessions
- **Improve Communication**: Refine how we communicate technical requirements

## Structure

Each prompt is documented with:
- **Timestamp**: When the prompt was created
- **Context**: What problem we're solving
- **Original Request**: What the user initially asked for
- **Refined Prompt**: The optimized version
- **Outcome**: What happened as a result
- **Lessons Learned**: What worked well or could be improved
