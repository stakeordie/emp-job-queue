# Base Machine vs Basic Machine: Key Implementation Differences

## Overview
This document compares the operational differences between the `base_machine` (Bash-based) and `basic_machine` (Node.js-based) implementations, focusing on startup processes, custom nodes installation, multi-GPU handling, and monitoring.

## 1. Architecture & Language

### Base Machine
- **Language**: Bash shell scripts
- **Structure**: Collection of shell scripts (`start.sh`, `mgpu`, `worker`, `comfyui`, `a1111`)
- **Service Management**: Custom init.d style scripts
- **Process Management**: Direct process control with PID files

### Basic Machine
- **Language**: Node.js/JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- **Structure**: Object-oriented with service classes
- **Service Management**: ServiceOrchestrator pattern
- **Process Management**: Node.js child processes with execa

## 2. Startup Process

### Base Machine - Sequential Phases
```bash
# start.sh follows a strict phase-based approach:
Phase 1: Check environment variables
Phase 2: Setup SSH access
Phase 3: Setup Git SSH authentication
Phase 3: Setup pre-installed nodes
Phase 4: Setup custom nodes
Phase 5: Start workflow auto-sync service
Phase 6: Model sync
Phase 6: Setup NGINX
Phase 8: Setup Automatic1111 instances
Phase 9: Setup ComfyUI instances
Phase 9: Setup service scripts
Phase 10: Start NGINX
Phase 11: Start ComfyUI services
Phase 11.1: Start Automatic1111 services
Phase 11.2: Setup static model symlinks
Phase 12.1: Setup Ollama
Phase 12.2: Start Ollama
Phase 13: Start Redis Workers
Phase 14: Verify all services
```

### Basic Machine - Parallel Phases
```javascript
// orchestrator.js uses parallel startup:
Phase 0: Setting up shared directories
Phase 1: Starting core infrastructure (nginx)
Phase 2: Starting AI services (parallel per GPU)
  - ComfyUI (all GPUs in parallel)
  - Automatic1111 (all GPUs in parallel)
  - Redis Workers (all GPUs in parallel)
Phase 3: Starting supporting services (ollama)
```

**Key Differences**:
- Base machine is strictly sequential with detailed logging
- Basic machine parallelizes GPU service startup for faster boot times
- Base machine has more granular phases (14 vs 4)

## 3. Multi-GPU Management

### Base Machine - mgpu Script
```bash
# Dedicated mgpu script handles all GPU operations
mgpu comfyui start 0    # Start ComfyUI on GPU 0
mgpu comfyui start all  # Start ComfyUI on all GPUs
mgpu comfyui logs all   # View logs for all GPUs
mgpu comfyui status all # Check status of all services

# Features:
- Validates GPU IDs against NUM_GPUS
- Supports "all" for batch operations
- Uses multitail for combined log viewing
- Each GPU gets separate directory (comfyui_gpu0, comfyui_gpu1, etc.)
```

### Basic Machine - ServiceOrchestrator
```javascript
// Automated GPU iteration in orchestrator
for (let gpu = 0; gpu < config.machine.gpu.count; gpu++) {
  if (config.services.comfyui.enabled) {
    aiServices.push(this.startService('comfyui', { gpu }));
  }
}
await Promise.all(aiServices);

// No manual GPU management commands
// Services automatically scale based on config.machine.gpu.count
```

**Key Differences**:
- Base machine has explicit GPU control via mgpu commands
- Basic machine automatically manages GPUs based on configuration
- Base machine allows individual GPU control; basic machine treats all GPUs uniformly

## 4. Custom Nodes Installation

### Base Machine - manage_custom_nodes Function
```bash
# Complex bash function with:
- JSON config parsing using jq
- Git clone/pull operations
- Branch and commit management
- Requirements installation
- Recursive cloning support
- Environment variable injection
- Error handling with retry logic
```

### Basic Machine - Shared Setup Service
```javascript
// Simplified approach:
- Calls setupBaseSharedDirectories from setup script
- No direct custom nodes management in main code
- Delegates to external setup script
```

**Key Differences**:
- Base machine has full custom nodes lifecycle management
- Basic machine relies on pre-setup or external scripts
- Base machine supports dynamic node installation during runtime

## 5. Worker Monitoring & Recovery

### Base Machine - Worker Watchdog
```bash
# Dedicated worker_watchdog.sh script:
- Monitors worker processes every 30 seconds
- Automatic restart on crash (up to 5 attempts)
- Per-worker restart flags (restart_enabled file)
- Restart counter tracking
- Graceful degradation after max attempts
```

### Basic Machine - Event-Based Monitoring
```javascript
// Service event listeners:
service.on('error', (error) => {
  logger.error(`Service ${serviceKey} error:`, error);
  this.emit('service-error', { service: serviceKey, error });
});

// Health check endpoint:
GET /health - Returns service health status
GET /status - Returns detailed service status
GET /ready - Simple readiness check
```

**Key Differences**:
- Base machine has active process monitoring with automatic recovery
- Basic machine uses passive event-based error handling
- Base machine has configurable restart policies per worker

## 6. Logging & Monitoring

### Base Machine
```bash
# Comprehensive logging:
- Central start.log for all operations
- Per-service logs (comfyui_gpu0/logs/output.log)
- Log rotation not built-in
- Direct file writing with timestamps
- mgpu logs command for viewing
```

### Basic Machine
```javascript
// Winston-based logging:
- Structured JSON logs
- Log levels (info, warn, error, debug)
- Daily rotation with winston-daily-rotate-file
- Centralized logger factory
- No built-in log viewing commands
```

**Key Differences**:
- Base machine uses simple file-based logging
- Basic machine has enterprise-grade logging with rotation
- Base machine includes log viewing tools; basic machine doesn't

## 7. Service Management

### Base Machine
```bash
# Direct service control:
service comfyui start 0   # Via init.d style scripts
service a1111 stop 0      # Direct process management
service worker restart 0  # PID file based

# Features:
- Custom ports via WORKER_BASE_COMFYUI_PORT
- Direct process control
- Simple PID-based status checking
```

### Basic Machine
```javascript
// Abstract service management:
await orchestrator.start();     // Start all services
await orchestrator.shutdown();  // Stop all services
orchestrator.getStatus();       // Get service status

// Features:
- Promise-based async operations
- Event-driven status updates
- Graceful shutdown handling
```

## 8. Configuration

### Base Machine
```bash
# Environment variable based:
NUM_GPUS=4
WORKER_BASE_COMFYUI_PORT=8188
WORKER_BASE_A1111_PORT=3001
MOCK_GPU=1  # For testing
```

### Basic Machine
```javascript
// Structured configuration:
config.machine.gpu.count
config.services.comfyui.enabled
config.services.comfyui.basePort
// Validated with Joi schemas
```

## 9. Error Handling

### Base Machine
- Shell script error codes
- Manual error checking after each command
- Log-based error reporting
- Continues on non-critical errors

### Basic Machine
- Try-catch blocks with proper error propagation
- Structured error objects
- Event-based error notification
- Fails fast on critical errors

## 10. Deployment & PM2

### Base Machine
- No built-in PM2 support
- Relies on system init scripts or manual process management
- Worker watchdog provides basic process supervision

### Basic Machine
- PM2-ready with proper Node.js structure
- Can be easily integrated into PM2 ecosystem
- Supports PM2 cluster mode for scaling

## Summary of Key Operational Improvements

### Recommendations for Basic Machine Enhancement:
1. Implement worker watchdog functionality as a monitoring service
