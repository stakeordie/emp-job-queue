## üéØ DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Core Services)
1. **Deploy database changes first**
   - Monitor connection stability for 30 minutes
   - **GO/NO-GO**: All existing queries working, no connection errors

2. **Deploy Redis connection improvements**
   - Monitor for connection errors and memory usage
   - **GO/NO-GO**: All services reconnect properly, no memory leaks

### Phase 2: Telemetry Migration
3. **Deploy OTEL-only telemetry**
   - Monitor Dash0 dashboard for data flow
   - **GO/NO-GO**: Traces, metrics, and logs appearing in Dash0

### Phase 3: Application Layer
4. **Deploy webhook service changes**
   - Test webhook registration/delivery immediately
   - **GO/NO-GO**: Webhooks processing normally, no 404 errors

5. **Deploy worker improvements**
   - Deploy new Ollama connector
   - **GO/NO-GO**: All worker types functioning, jobs processing

### Phase 4: Development Tools
6. **Deploy ngrok health system**
   - Lower risk, primarily development impact
   - **GO/NO-GO**: Tunnel management working in dev environment

## üîç POST-DEPLOYMENT MONITORING (First 24 Hours)

### Critical Metrics to Watch
- **Redis connection count**: Should be stable, not growing
- **Job processing rate**: Should match historical patterns
- **Webhook delivery success rate**: > 95%
- **API response times**: < 200ms P95
- **Memory usage**: No unexpected growth patterns
- **Error rates**: < 0.1% for critical paths

### Immediate Alerts (< 5 minutes)
- [ ] Redis connection failures
- [ ] Database query errors
- [ ] Webhook delivery failures > 5%
- [ ] Job processing stopped > 2 minutes
- [ ] OTEL export failures

### Hourly Checks (First 24 hours)
- [ ] Verify telemetry data flowing to Dash0
- [ ] Check for memory leaks in all services
- [ ] Monitor job queue depth and processing times
- [ ] Verify webhook success rates
- [ ] Check for any new error patterns

## üîÑ ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Redis Connection Issues
**Time to rollback**: < 5 minutes
```bash
# Rollback to previous Redis connection logic
git revert <redis-commit-hash>
# Redeploy affected services immediately
```

### Telemetry Issues
**Time to rollback**: < 10 minutes
```bash
# Re-enable FluentBit if OTEL fails
# Restore previous telemetry configuration
# Monitor for data recovery in Dash0
```

### Webhook Failures
**Time to rollback**: < 5 minutes
```bash
# Critical for customer notifications
# Rollback webhook service initialization changes
# Verify webhook delivery resumes immediately
```

### Database Issues
**Time to rollback**: < 15 minutes
```bash
# Rollback database package changes
# Run database migration rollback if needed
# Verify all queries working
```

## üö® EMERGENCY CONTACTS & PROCEDURES

### Critical Service Failure
1. **Immediate**: Rollback affected component
2. **Within 10 minutes**: Notify stakeholders
3. **Within 30 minutes**: Root cause analysis
4. **Within 1 hour**: Incident report

### Monitoring Dashboard URLs
- **Dash0**: [Monitor telemetry and performance]
- **Redis**: Use `redis-cli` for direct monitoring
- **Job Queue**: Monitor service logs and processing rates

## üìä SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] Webhook delivery success rate > 95%
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Telemetry data flowing normally to Dash0
- [ ] No increase in error rates
- [ ] All manual tests passing

### Performance Targets
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms P95
- **Job Processing**: No degradation vs baseline

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-27 (UPDATED WITH TEST VERIFICATION)
**Review Required**: Before each production deployment
**Estimated Deployment Time**: 2-4 hours (phased approach)
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH (reduced from HIGH due to test coverage)

## ‚úÖ TEST COVERAGE SUMMARY

### Verified with Unit Tests:

- **Redis Connection Resilience**: Comprehensive tests for retry logic and error handling
- **Safe Redis Operations**: Wrapper patterns tested to prevent service crashes
- **Environment Configuration**: Flexible configuration tested across services
- **Monitor Service Redis Manager**: New resilient connection manager fully tested

### Still Requiring Manual Verification:
- **Telemetry/OTEL Migration**: No automated tests, HIGH RISK
- **Actual Webhook Delivery**: External endpoint testing needed
- **Database Package Integration**: End-to-end testing required
- **Ollama Connector**: New connector needs production-like testing
- **Performance Under Load**: Load testing not automated
