# Deployment Changelog - September 2025

## Overview
This deployment includes significant infrastructure improvements, Redis connection robustness enhancements, testing framework implementation, and production environment configuration fixes. All changes advance toward the North Star architecture of specialized machine pools with intelligent model management.

## üö® Critical Infrastructure Fixes

### Redis Connection Robustness (Commits: 35748a8, 550e01e)
**Problem**: Services crashed when Redis was unavailable during startup
**Solution**:
- Implemented robust Redis connection retry logic across all services
- Added graceful degradation for Redis operations in monitor service
- Fixed webhook service initialization order bug that prevented route access
- Added comprehensive error handling with descriptive error messages

**Files Changed**:
- `apps/webhook-service/src/webhook-server.ts` - Fixed initialization order
- `apps/monitor/src/lib/redis-connection.ts` - New centralized Redis manager
- `packages/core/src/redis-service.ts` - Enhanced connection resilience

### Production Environment Configuration (Commit: 48f87ed)
**Problem**: Environment configuration inconsistencies between local and production
**Solution**:
- Fixed NEXT_PUBLIC_CONNECTIONS format in monitor production config
- Verified database URL security (properly in .env.secret files)
- Standardized environment variable patterns across services
- Removed duplicate DATABASE_URL from non-secret files

**Files Changed**:
- `apps/monitor/.env.production` - Fixed JSON array format
- Environment audit across all services

## üîß Development Infrastructure Improvements

### Ngrok Tunnel Management (Commit: 941a02d)
**Enhancement**: Automated tunnel health checking and management
- Created `scripts/ngrok-health-check.js` for automatic tunnel startup
- Updated ngrok configuration with EmProps API, MiniApp, and Job Queue tunnels
- Integrated tunnel management into development dashboard
- Added OrbStack error filtering to reduce log clutter

### Testing Infrastructure (Commit: 88da2b8)
**Enhancement**: Comprehensive testing framework with production data safety
- Implemented vitest testing framework across all packages
- Added VSCode vitest extension configuration
- Created Neon database branching script for safe production testing
- Added unit tests for critical infrastructure components:
  - `apps/webhook-service/src/__tests__/webhook-server.test.ts` (13 tests)
  - `apps/monitor/src/__tests__/redis-connection-simple.test.ts` (9 tests)

## üéØ Feature Enhancements

### Monitor UI Improvements (Commits: 246cf29, 2415e0b)
**Enhancement**: Added webhook trigger functionality to job list view
- "Trigger Webhook" button now available for all jobs in list view
- Uses job.workflow_id or falls back to job.id for broader compatibility
- Consistent with existing "Retry Job" and "Reset Job" button patterns
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### Worker Mock System (Commit: c70df18)
**Enhancement**: Staging initialization and mock capabilities
- Added comprehensive mock system for worker testing
- Implemented staging initialization patterns
- Enhanced worker capability reporting

### Ollama Connector (Commit: 87e5e74)
**Enhancement**: Complete Ollama integration with asset management
- Full Ollama connector implementation with asset saving
- Attestation support for job completion tracking
- Integrated with existing Redis job broker

## üîÑ **MAJOR: Complete FluentD/FluentBit Removal** (Commit: 70f1ba9)
**BREAKING CHANGE**: Complete removal of FluentBit/FluentD telemetry stack
- **Deleted entire `apps/fluentd/` service directory** (9 files removed)
- **Removed all FluentBit configuration files** across all services:
  - `apps/api/conf/fluent-bit-*.conf.template` (2 files)
  - `apps/machine/conf/fluent-bit-*.conf*` (3 files)
  - `apps/webhook-service/conf/fluent-bit-webhook.conf.template`
  - `apps/worker/conf/fluent-bit-worker.conf`
  - `local-dev/fluent-bit/fluent-bit-local.conf`
- **Updated all Dockerfiles** to remove FluentBit installation steps
- **Removed FluentBit transport modules** from telemetry packages
- **Updated install-telemetry-stack.sh** scripts across all services
- **Migrated to direct OTEL collector integration** for traces and metrics
- **Enhanced database abstraction** with new `packages/database/` package
- **Removed deprecated emprops-prisma-client** package (replaced with new database layer)

**Impact**: Simplified telemetry stack, improved performance by removing intermediate log processing layers

## üìã Production Testing Strategy

### Neon Database Branching
- **Script**: `packages/database/test-with-neon-branch.sh`
- **Purpose**: Create temporary production data branches for safe testing
- **Process**: Branch creation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Automatic cleanup
- **Safety**: Zero risk to production data

### Manual Testing Checklist
Refer to `docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for comprehensive testing procedures including:
- Redis connection resilience verification
- Webhook service route accessibility
- Monitor UI functionality validation
- Worker job processing capabilities
- Database migration verification

## üîç Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Changes ‚úÖ
- Environment configuration fixes (cosmetic JSON format)
- Testing infrastructure additions (no runtime impact)
- Development tooling improvements (ngrok, VSCode config)

### Medium Risk Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Redis connection retry logic (improved error handling)
- Webhook service initialization order fix (resolves existing bug)
- Monitor Redis operation safety wrappers (graceful degradation)

### Critical Success Metrics
- **Zero service downtime** during Redis unavailability
- **Webhook endpoints accessible** immediately after deployment
- **Job processing continuity** maintained throughout deployment
- **Monitor UI functionality** preserved with enhanced capabilities

## üöÄ Deployment Readiness

### Pre-Deployment Verification
1. **Environment Variables**: All production configs validated and secured
2. **Database Schema**: No breaking changes, existing schema compatible
3. **Service Dependencies**: Enhanced Redis resilience prevents cascade failures
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain API compatibility

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
1. **Redis Connection Health**: Monitor connection retry patterns
2. **Webhook Service Accessibility**: Verify /webhooks endpoints respond
3. **Job Processing Flow**: Confirm worker job claiming and completion
4. **Monitor UI Functionality**: Test job list actions and forensics

## üí° North Star Alignment

All changes advance toward the North Star architecture:
- **Redis Function Evolution**: Enhanced job matching capabilities
- **Specialized Pool Foundation**: Improved worker capability reporting
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Better visibility into job routing and completion
- **Testing Foundation**: Infrastructure for validating pool-specific routing
- **Production Readiness**: Robust systems capable of elastic scaling
