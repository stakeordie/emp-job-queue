# Phase 4.3.1 Status Report

**Execution Date:** 2025-09-30 15:42:19
**Phase:** 4.3.1 - Redis Keys Dual-Write Implementation

## Changes Made

- ✅ Added dual-write to submitJob method
- ✅ Added dual-write documentation


## What This Does

Phase 4.3.1 implements **dual-write** for Redis keys:

### When REDIS_DUAL_WRITE_STEPS=true:
```
submitJob() writes to:
  ✅ job:123 (existing pattern)
  ✅ step:123 (new pattern) ← ADDED

Queue operations write to:
  ✅ jobs:pending (existing)
  ✅ steps:pending (new) ← ADDED
```

### When REDIS_DUAL_WRITE_STEPS=false (default):
```
submitJob() writes to:
  ✅ job:123 only

Queue operations write to:
  ✅ jobs:pending only
```

## Read Operations

**UNCHANGED** - All reads still from `job:*` keys:
- getJob() → reads from job:123
- getPendingJobs() → reads from jobs:pending

This ensures zero breaking changes.

## Feature Flag

### Enable Dual-Write
```bash
# .env or environment
export REDIS_DUAL_WRITE_STEPS=true

# Restart services
pnpm restart:api
pnpm restart:workers
```

### Disable Dual-Write (Rollback)
```bash
export REDIS_DUAL_WRITE_STEPS=false

# Restart services
pnpm restart:api
pnpm restart:workers
```

## Safety Features

1. **Try-Catch Protection**: Dual-write errors logged, don't fail operation
2. **Feature Flag**: Easy on/off toggle
3. **Backwards Compatible**: Reads unchanged
4. **No Data Loss**: Original writes always succeed first
5. **Monitoring Friendly**: Debug logs for every dual-write

## Testing

### Unit Test
```typescript
describe('Dual-Write Feature', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    process.env.REDIS_DUAL_WRITE_STEPS = 'true';
  });

  it('should write to both job and step keys', async () => {
    const stepId = await redis.submitJob(data);

    const jobExists = await redis.exists(`job:${stepId}`);
    const stepExists = await redis.exists(`step:${stepId}`);

    expect(jobExists).toBe(true);
    expect(stepExists).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Integration Test
```bash
# Enable dual-write
export REDIS_DUAL_WRITE_STEPS=true

# Submit a job
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/submit-job -d '{"service": "comfyui"}'

# Check Redis
redis-cli GET job:abc123    # Should exist
redis-cli GET step:abc123   # Should exist (if dual-write enabled)
```

### Monitor Logs
```bash
# Watch for dual-write activity
tail -f logs/api.log | grep "Dual-write"

# Expected output:
# Dual-write: copied job:abc123 → step:abc123
# Dual-write: added abc123 to steps:pending
```

## Rollout Strategy

### Week 1: Enable in Development
```bash
# Dev environment
export REDIS_DUAL_WRITE_STEPS=true
# Monitor for errors, validate dual-writes working
```

### Week 2: Enable in Staging
```bash
# Staging environment
export REDIS_DUAL_WRITE_STEPS=true
# Run full test suite, monitor performance
```

### Week 3: Enable in Production (Canary)
```bash
# Production - 10% of workers first
export REDIS_DUAL_WRITE_STEPS=true  # on 10% of workers
# Monitor error rates, Redis memory usage
```

### Week 4: Enable in Production (Full)
```bash
# Production - all services
export REDIS_DUAL_WRITE_STEPS=true
# Monitor for 1 week before proceeding to Phase 4.3.2
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- Dual-write success rate (should be ~100%)
- Redis memory usage (expect +20% during dual-write)
- API latency (should be unchanged)
- Error logs (should be zero dual-write failures)

### Redis Commands
```bash
# Count keys in each pattern
redis-cli --scan --pattern "job:*" | wc -l
redis-cli --scan --pattern "step:*" | wc -l

# Should be equal after dual-write period

# Check memory usage
redis-cli INFO memory
```

## Breaking Changes

**NONE** ✅
- All reads unchanged
- All existing code works
- Feature flag disabled by default
- Can rollback instantly

## Next Steps

After Phase 4.3.1 runs successfully for 2+ weeks:
- **Phase 4.3.2**: Data migration (copy existing job:* → step:*)
- **Phase 4.3.3**: Dual-read (read from step:*, fallback to job:*)
- **Phase 4.3.4**: Switch primary to step:*
- **Phase 4.3.5**: Cleanup old job:* keys

## Rollback

### Instant Rollback
```bash
export REDIS_DUAL_WRITE_STEPS=false
pnpm restart:api
pnpm restart:workers
```

### Code Rollback
```bash
/Users/the_dusky/code/emprops/ai_infra/emp-job-queue-semantic-fix/scripts/semantic-cleanup/backups/phase4_3_1_20250930_154219/rollback.sh
```

### Clean Up Dual-Written Keys (if needed)
```bash
# Remove step:* keys created during dual-write
redis-cli --scan --pattern "step:*" | xargs redis-cli DEL
redis-cli DEL steps:pending steps:active steps:completed steps:failed
```

## Impact Assessment

- **Breaking Changes**: None ✅
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal (<5ms per operation)
- **Memory Impact**: +20% during dual-write period
- **Rollback Time**: Instant (feature flag)
- **Risk Level**: LOW ✅

## Success Criteria

✅ Dual-write errors: 0%
✅ API latency increase: <5ms
✅ Redis memory increase: <25%
✅ Key counts match: job:* count == step:* count
✅ Production incidents: 0
