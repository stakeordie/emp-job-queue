# RESTART - System Status and Current Tasks

## Current Status
**PHASE 1 COMPLETE**: Core sync and monitor functionality working correctly.

## Recently Completed ✅
1. **Sync Job State**: Fixed sync_job_state routing from monitor to client WebSocket
2. **Monitor Architecture**: Enforced read-only design with TypeScript type guards
3. **Orphaned Job Detection**: Implemented proper detection and cleanup of abandoned jobs
4. **Docker Startup Race**: Fixed worker connection issues with healthcheck dependencies
5. **WebSocket Dual Connection**: Proper separation of monitor (read-only) vs client (control) connections

## Current Architecture Status

### ✅ WebSocket Architecture
- **Monitor WebSocket**: Read-only observer (monitor_connect, subscribe, heartbeat, resync_request)
- **Client WebSocket**: Control operations (submit_job, sync_job_state, cancel_job)
- **TypeScript Enforcement**: Compile-time prevention of control ops in monitor handler

### ✅ Job Processing Flow
- **Sync Functionality**: Now properly detects orphaned jobs and resets them to pending
- **Worker Registration**: Proper capability-based job matching
- **Priority Handling**: FIFO within priority levels working correctly
- **Docker Health**: Workers wait for hub readiness before connecting

## Next Priority Tasks

### 1. End-to-End Testing
- Test complete job lifecycle: submit → assign → process → complete
- Verify sync functionality works with real job scenarios
- Test worker failure and recovery scenarios

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Monitor Redis connection pooling
- Optimize job matching algorithms
- Add job queue metrics and monitoring

### 3. Production Readiness
- Add comprehensive logging
- Implement graceful shutdown handling
- Add health check endpoints for all services

## Development Environment

### Start System
```bash
cd /Users/the_dusky/code/emprops/ai_infra/emp-job-queue
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
cd apps/monitor-nextjs && pnpm dev  # If monitor not running on :3003
```

### Service URLs  
- **Hub API**: http://localhost:3001
- **Hub WebSocket**: ws://localhost:3002
- **Monitor**: http://localhost:3003
- **Workers**: localhost:1511-1514 (dashboards)
- **Redis**: localhost:6379

### Key Recent Files Modified
- `src/core/message-handler.ts` - Added sync_job_state handling with orphaned job detection
- `src/hub/monitor-websocket-handler.ts` - TypeScript enforcement for read-only operations
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Added healthcheck for proper startup ordering
- `src/services/event-broadcaster.ts` - Enhanced event routing
- `src/types/monitor-events.ts` - Updated event type definitions

## System Health Verification
```bash
# Check all services
docker ps
docker logs hub-dev --tail 20
docker logs worker1-dev --tail 10

# Test sync functionality
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/sync/job-state \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job_id": "test-job-id"}'
```

The core job broker architecture is now solid and ready for comprehensive testing and production deployment preparation.
