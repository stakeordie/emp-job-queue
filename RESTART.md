# Quick Status - Job Queue Orchestration

## Current State (2025-07-04)
- âœ… Real-time job progress updates working
- âœ… Real-time worker status updates working  
- âœ… Monitor UI showing live worker status changes
- ðŸš§ Starting Redis Function-based orchestration

## What We Just Completed
1. Fixed worker status updates not showing in UI
2. Fixed worker ID matching issues in full state processing
3. Reduced WorkerCard size by 50% for better UI density
4. Workers now show busy/idle status in real-time

## Next: Orchestration Implementation
We're implementing Redis Functions for intelligent job matching:
- Workers will only get jobs they can actually process
- Atomic server-side matching (no race conditions)
- Support for unlimited custom capabilities
- See `ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md` for detailed steps

## Quick Commands
```bash
# Start development
pnpm dev:api
pnpm dev:worker

# Run with docker
pnpm docker:up

# View monitor
open http://localhost:3000
```

## Current Architecture
```
Workers â†’ Redis Functions â†’ Matching Logic â†’ Job Assignment
   â†“                                              â†“
Capabilities                                  Requirements
```

Instead of workers blindly taking any job, they'll call a Redis function that finds the best matching job based on their capabilities.
