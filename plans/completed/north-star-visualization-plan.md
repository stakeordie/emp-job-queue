# North Star Visualization Dashboard - Project Plan

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Extend the existing monitor application with North Star-aligned visualization to track production health and measure progress toward the specialized pools architecture.

**Scope**: Pure visualization extension - no infrastructure changes, leveraging existing WebSocket events and Redis data.

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (iterative delivery)

- âœ… Job submission flow: client â†’ API â†’ Redis â†’ worker â†’ ComfyUI/simulation
- âœ… Machine status cards showing health, workers, job processing

### Current Data Streams Available
- Machine startup/shutdown events
- Worker registration and health status
- Job submission â†’ queue â†’ processing â†’ completion flow

- **Incomplete Data**: Validate data sources early, implement fallbacks
- **User Confusion**: Clear separation between current state and future North Star

### Mitigation Strategies
- Iterative delivery with constant user feedback
- Performance monitoring throughout development
- Clear documentation of current vs future state
- Fallback to basic monitoring if advanced features fail
