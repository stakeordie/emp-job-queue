## 🚀 **HIGH PRIORITY (Weeks 3-6)**

### 4. **Intelligent Retry Logic System** 🟡
**Goal**: Smart failure handling based on failure type classification

#### Failure Classification Engine
```typescript
enum FailureType {
  RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION,  // OOM, GPU memory → retry different worker
  MALFORMED_JOB,       // Invalid payload → fail fast  
  TRANSIENT_ERROR,     // Network timeout → exponential backoff
  WORKER_UNAVAILABLE   // Single worker down → delayed retry
}
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build failure classification engine with pattern matching
- [ ] Implement retry strategies (immediate, backoff, fail-fast)
- [ ] Enhanced worker error reporting with context
- [ ] Failure pattern analytics and learning
- [ ] Admin interface for retry policy management

### 5. **Worker Auto-Update System** 🟡
**Goal**: Seamless worker deployments to GPU machines

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build worker auto-updater with graceful job completion
- [ ] Create worker health monitoring and validation
- [ ] Implement rollback capability for failed updates
- [ ] Set up Docker registry integration
- [ ] Add deployment monitoring and alerting

### 6. **Background Task Management** 🟡
**Goal**: Automated system maintenance and monitoring

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Job cleanup processes (remove old completed/failed jobs)
- [ ] Worker heartbeat monitoring and timeout detection  
- [ ] Performance metrics collection and storage
- [ ] System health monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Orphaned job detection and recovery

- [ ] Finish WebSocket connector bidirectional communication (395 lines)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Integration testing with real AI services

### 8. **Enhanced Monitoring & Analytics** 🟡
**Goal**: Production-grade observability and debugging

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Failure analytics dashboard with pattern recognition
- [ ] Performance metrics visualization and alerting
- [ ] Job flow debugging and tracing tools
- [ ] System bottleneck identification and recommendations
- [ ] Advanced logging and error tracking

### 9. **Worker Dashboard Interface** 🟡  
**Goal**: Real-time worker monitoring and management

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Real-time job monitoring interface
- [ ] Connector health status displays
- [ ] Performance metrics visualization  
- [ ] Job history and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Worker configuration management
