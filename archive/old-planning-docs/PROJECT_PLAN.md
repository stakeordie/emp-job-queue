# EmProps Job Queue - Project Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Foundation)

### 1.1 Job Broker Core Logic
**File**: `tasks/backlog/implement-job-broker-core.md`  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Description**: Implement Redis-based job queue with priority + FIFO ordering, job submission, and basic job lifecycle management.

### 1.2 Workflow Priority Inheritance  
**File**: `tasks/backlog/implement-workflow-priority-inheritance.md`  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: 1.1 (Job Broker Core)  
**Description**: Implement workflow-level priority inheritance so job steps maintain proper ordering without complex workflow management.

### 1.3 Message Processing System
**File**: `tasks/backlog/implement-message-processing.md`  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: 1.1 (Job Broker Core)  
**Description**: Complete implementation of all 30+ WebSocket message types for hub-worker communication.

## Phase 2: Worker System (Job Processing)

### 2.1 Worker Job Selection Logic
**File**: `tasks/backlog/implement-worker-job-selection.md`  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3  
**Description**: Implement pull-based job claiming with capability matching, timeouts, and conflict resolution.

### 2.2 Service Connector Implementations  
**File**: `tasks/backlog/complete-connector-implementations.md`  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: 2.1  
**Description**: Complete ComfyUI, A1111, and simulation connectors with proper error handling and progress reporting.

## Phase 3: System Reliability (Production Readiness)

### 3.1 Comprehensive Testing Suite
**File**: `tasks/backlog/add-comprehensive-testing.md`  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: 2.1, 2.2  
**Description**: Implement unit, integration, and e2e tests with 95% coverage for core job broker logic.

### 3.2 Background Task Processing
**File**: `tasks/backlog/implement-background-tasks.md`  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: 1.1, 1.3  
**Description**: Worker health monitoring, job timeout handling, cleanup tasks, and system maintenance.

## Phase 4: Monitoring & Operations (Observability)

### 4.1 Worker Dashboard
**File**: `tasks/backlog/build-worker-dashboard.md`  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: 2.1, 3.2  
**Description**: Real-time monitoring dashboard for job queues, worker status, and system metrics.

### 4.2 Production Deployment
**File**: `tasks/backlog/add-production-deployment.md`  
**Priority**: Low  
**Dependencies**: 3.1, 4.1  
**Description**: Docker production setup, PM2 configuration, logging, and deployment automation.
