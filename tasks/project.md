## Task Management Workflow

### Task States
- **backlog**: Task defined but not started
- **in_progress**: Currently being worked on
- **complete**: Task finished and verified

### Moving Tasks
```bash
# When starting a task
mv tasks/backlog/[task-name].md tasks/in_progress/

# When completing a task  
mv tasks/in_progress/[task-name].md tasks/complete/
```

### Daily Progress Tracking
- Review tasks in `in_progress/` folder
- Move completed tasks to `complete/` folder
- Pull next task from backlog based on phase order
- Update this project.md with progress notes

---

## Notes & Decisions
- **Framework Choice**: Next.js 14 with App Router (familiar to developer)
- **State Management**: Zustand (simpler than Redux, perfect for this use case)
- **Testing**: Vitest + RTL + Playwright (modern, fast, reliable)
- **UI Design System**: shadcn/ui + Radix UI primitives (professional, accessible, modern)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables (consistent theming, responsive)
- **Icons**: Lucide React (beautiful, consistent iconography)
- **Forms**: react-hook-form + Zod (type-safe validation, excellent UX)
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript (catch errors at compile time)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance (keyboard nav, screen readers, focus management)

This project plan ensures we methodically transform the chaotic monitor into a production-ready application that's maintainable, testable, and reliable.
