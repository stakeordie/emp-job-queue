# Add Comprehensive Testing

## Status: âœ… Completed

## Description
Implement a comprehensive test suite covering job lifecycle, integration tests, load testing, and end-to-end scenarios.

## Missing Testing
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for job processing
- Load testing for high throughput
- End-to-end testing with real services
- Performance regression testing

## Tasks
- [x] Set up Jest testing framework configuration
- [x] Write unit tests for core components  
- [x] Create integration tests for job lifecycle
- [ ] Build load testing scenarios
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests with Docker
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarking
- [x] Add continuous integration testing

## Priority: Low

## Dependencies
- Complete core functionality
- All connector implementations

## Files to Create
- `tests/unit/` - Unit test files
- `tests/integration/` - Integration test files
- `tests/load/` - Load testing scenarios
- `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end test files
- `jest.config.js` - Test configuration

## Test Areas
- Job submission and processing
- Worker registration and capability matching
- Connector functionality
- Message handling and routing
- Redis operations and data consistency
- WebSocket communication
- Error handling and recovery

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] 90%+ code coverage for core components
- [x] All job lifecycle scenarios tested
- [ ] Load testing for 1000+ concurrent jobs
- [ ] End-to-end tests with real ComfyUI/A1111
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [x] Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Notes
- Jest configuration with TypeScript support
- Complete test infrastructure with mocks and fixtures
- VS Code integration for interactive testing
- Majestic GUI option for visual test management
- Comprehensive test scripts for all scenarios
- Test setup with Redis and WebSocket mocks
