# Monitor Event Integration - Phase 2

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

**Completed Date**: 2025-01-01  
**Implementation Summary**: Successfully replaced polling-based stats_broadcast with real-time event system

## Description
Complete the event-driven monitor system by integrating the Phase 1 event infrastructure with the actual worker/job lifecycle methods and updating the monitor frontend to consume real-time events instead of polling.

## Prerequisites
✅ Phase 1 Complete: Event infrastructure implemented
- EventBroadcaster service ready
- MonitorWebSocketHandler implemented
- Event type definitions complete
- WebSocket integration done

## Phase 2 Tasks

### 2.1 Hub Integration - Add Event Broadcasting to Lifecycle Methods

**Priority: High**

#### Worker Lifecycle Events
- [x] **Worker Registration**: Broadcast `worker_connected` when worker registers
  - File: `src/core/message-handler.ts` - handleWorkerRegistration()
  - Integration: Call `eventBroadcaster.broadcastWorkerConnected()`

- [x] **Worker Disconnection**: Broadcast `worker_disconnected` when worker disconnects  
  - File: `src/core/message-handler.ts` - handleWorkerDisconnect()
  - Integration: Call `eventBroadcaster.broadcastWorkerDisconnected()`

- [x] **Worker Status Changes**: Broadcast `worker_status_changed` when worker status updates
  - File: `src/core/redis-service.ts` - updateWorkerStatus()
  - Integration: Call `eventBroadcaster.broadcastWorkerStatusChanged()`

#### Job Lifecycle Events
- [x] **Job Submission**: Broadcast `job_submitted` when job is submitted
  - File: `src/core/message-handler.ts` - handleJobSubmission()
  - Integration: Call `eventBroadcaster.broadcastJobSubmitted()`

- [x] **Job Assignment**: Broadcast `job_assigned` when job is claimed by worker
  - File: `src/core/redis-service.ts` - claimJob()
  - Integration: Call `eventBroadcaster.broadcastJobAssigned()`

- [x] **Job Status Changes**: Broadcast `job_status_changed` for all status transitions
  - File: `src/core/redis-service.ts` - updateJobStatus()
  - Integration: Call `eventBroadcaster.broadcastJobStatusChanged()`

- [x] **Job Progress**: Broadcast `job_progress` when progress updates received
  - File: `src/core/message-handler.ts` - handleJobProgress()
  - Integration: Call `eventBroadcaster.broadcastJobProgress()`

- [x] **Job Completion**: Broadcast `job_completed` when job finishes successfully
  - File: `src/core/message-handler.ts` - handleJobCompletion()
  - Integration: Call `eventBroadcaster.broadcastJobCompleted()`

- [x] **Job Failure**: Broadcast `job_failed` when job fails
  - File: `src/core/message-handler.ts` - handleJobFailure()
  - Integration: Call `eventBroadcaster.broadcastJobFailed()`

#### Hub Service Integration
- [x] **EventBroadcaster Integration**: Ensure EventBroadcaster is available in all services
  - File: `src/hub/index.ts` - Initialize and pass EventBroadcaster to services
  - File: `src/core/message-handler.ts` - Accept EventBroadcaster in constructor
  - File: `src/core/redis-service.ts` - Accept EventBroadcaster in constructor

  - Feature: Added subscription management and heartbeat system
  - Feature: Connection health monitoring with automatic heartbeat

- [x] **Manual Connection**: Ensure manual connection only
  - File: `apps/monitor-nextjs/src/store/index.ts`
  - Feature: Verified manual connection workflow maintained

### 2.3 Testing & Validation

## Implementation Order

### Step 1: Hub Event Integration (1-2 days)
1. Initialize EventBroadcaster in HubServer
2. Pass EventBroadcaster to MessageHandler and RedisService
3. Add event broadcasting to worker registration/disconnection
4. Add event broadcasting to job submission/assignment/completion
5. Test events are being broadcast (can use Redis monitor or debug logs)

### Step 2: Monitor Frontend Updates (1-2 days)  
1. Update WebSocket service to request full state and subscribe to events
2. Add event type definitions for monitor
3. Update store to handle real-time events instead of stats_broadcast
4. Remove stats_broadcast handling completely
5. Test monitor receives and processes events correctly

### Step 3: Testing & Refinement (1 day)
1. End-to-end testing of complete flow
2. Performance benchmarking vs old system
3. Multiple monitor testing
4. Bug fixes and edge case handling

## Expected Results

### Before Phase 2 (Current State)
- Monitor polls hub every 2 seconds with stats_broadcast
- 2-second delay for all updates
- Potential for missed events between polls
- High network traffic for full state transfers

### After Phase 2 (Target State)  
- Monitor receives instant event notifications
- Sub-100ms update latency
- Zero missed events
- 80%+ reduction in network traffic
- Better user experience with real-time updates
