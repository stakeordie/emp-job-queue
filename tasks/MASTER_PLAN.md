- [ ] Implement cancel functionality to mark job as failed and remove
- [ ] Add confirmation dialog for cancel action
- [ ] Test sync and cancel operations work correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each job in queue has sync and cancel buttons
- Sync button refreshes job state from server
- Cancel button marks job as failed and removes from queue
- Cancel action has confirmation to prevent accidents

**Estimated**: 6-8 hours

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for build/test/deploy
- [ ] Configure Railway deployment automation
- [ ] Set up Docker image building and pushing
- [ ] Add deployment health checks and rollback

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Hub auto-deploys to Railway on main branch push

## ðŸ“‹ **TASK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL**

### Status Values
- `NOT_STARTED` - Ready to begin
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Currently working on
- `BLOCKED` - Waiting for dependency/decision
- `REVIEW` - Needs testing/validation
- `COMPLETED` - Done and verified

### Priority Levels
- ðŸ”´ `CRITICAL` - Blocking production/development
- ðŸŸ¡ `HIGH` - Important for next milestone
- ðŸŸ¢ `MEDIUM` - Valuable but not urgent
- âšª `LOW` - Nice to have

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start of Session**: Read this file to see current active tasks
2. **Pick Next Task**: Select highest priority `NOT_STARTED` task
3. **Update Status**: Change task status to `IN_PROGRESS`
4. **Use TodoWrite**: Create specific subtask tracking for the work
5. **Complete Work**: Update status to `REVIEW` or `COMPLETED`
6. **Update This File**: Mark completed subtasks and move to next

### Task Completion Checklist
- [ ] All subtasks completed and tested
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Code changes committed
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Task status updated to `COMPLETED`
- [ ] Next task identified and status updated

## ðŸ”„ **INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS**

This plan integrates with:
- **TodoRead/TodoWrite**: For fine-grained subtask tracking during work sessions
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Historical record of completed work
- **GitHub Issues**: For external collaboration and bug tracking
- **Railway Deployments**: For production deployment tracking

**Usage Pattern:**
1. Claude reads this file at session start
2. Uses TodoWrite for detailed subtask breakdown during work
3. Updates this file with progress and completion
4. Updates CHANGELOG.md when major milestones reached
5. Commits all progress before session end
