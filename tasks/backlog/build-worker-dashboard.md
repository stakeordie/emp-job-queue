# Build Worker Dashboard

## Status: Backlog

## Description
Implement the real-time worker dashboard that provides job monitoring, connector status, and performance metrics for individual workers.

## Current Status
- Basic worker dashboard file exists but is mostly unimplemented
- Needs real-time job monitoring capabilities
- Missing connector status displays
- No performance metrics tracking

## Tasks
- [ ] Complete worker dashboard implementation
- [ ] Add real-time job status monitoring
- [ ] Implement connector health and status displays
- [ ] Add performance metrics (jobs/hour, processing time, etc.)
- [ ] Create worker capability overview
- [ ] Add job history and logs viewer
- [ ] Implement WebSocket connection for real-time updates

## Priority: Low

## Dependencies
- Background task management (for metrics collection)
- Complete connector implementations (for status display)

## Files to Modify
- `src/worker/worker-dashboard.ts` - Complete implementation
- `src/worker/base-worker.ts` - Add metrics collection
- `src/worker/connector-manager.ts` - Add status reporting

## Reference Implementation
- Python worker dashboard patterns
- Simple redis monitor for UI inspiration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time job progress display
- [ ] Connector health status indicators
- [ ] Performance metrics and graphs
- [ ] Job history with filtering
- [ ] Worker configuration display
- [ ] Responsive web interface accessible via browser
