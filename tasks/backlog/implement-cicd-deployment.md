# Implement CI/CD Deployment Pipeline

## Status: High Priority - Backlog

## Description
Build comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for automated hub deployment to Railway and GPU worker deployment to machines.

## Requirements

### Hub Deployment (Railway)
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch
- **Actions**: 
  - Build hub Docker image
  - Run tests and linting
  - Deploy to Railway with zero downtime
  - Health check validation
  - Rollback on failure

### Worker Deployment (GPU Machines)
- **Trigger**: Manual or automated based on worker image changes
- **Actions**:
  - Build worker Docker image
  - Push to container registry
  - Deploy to GPU machines via self-updating mechanism
  - Validate worker registration with hub
  - Health monitoring

## Technical Implementation

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    - Run unit/integration tests
    - TypeScript compilation
    - Linting and formatting
    
  build-hub:
    - Build hub Docker image
    - Push to Railway registry
    
  build-worker:
    - Build worker Docker image
    - Push to Docker Hub/GHCR
    
  deploy-hub:
    - Deploy to Railway
    - Health checks
    - Rollback logic
    
  deploy-workers:
    - Trigger worker updates on GPU machines
    - Monitor worker health
```

### Worker Auto-Update System
- **Pull-based Updates**: Workers check for new images periodically
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Finish current jobs before updating
- **Health Validation**: Verify worker functionality after update
- **Rollback Capability**: Revert to previous version on failure

## Tasks
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for hub deployment
- [ ] Set up Railway deployment configuration
- [ ] Build worker auto-update mechanism
- [ ] Implement health check systems
- [ ] Create deployment monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Add rollback automation
- [ ] Test deployment pipeline end-to-end

## Files to Create
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline
- `scripts/deploy-hub.sh` - Hub deployment script
- `scripts/update-workers.sh` - Worker update script
- `src/worker/auto-updater.ts` - Worker self-update logic
- `docker/railway.Dockerfile` - Railway-specific hub image
- `docker/worker-prod.Dockerfile` - Production worker image

## Dependencies
- Railway deployment configuration
- Container registry setup (Docker Hub/GHCR)
- GPU machine access and deployment keys
- Health check endpoint implementation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Hub automatically deploys to Railway on main branch push
- [ ] Workers can self-update without manual intervention
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployments with automatic rollback
- [ ] Health monitoring and alerting for all deployments
- [ ] Complete audit trail of deployments and changes
